    <h1>Tritonus Developer Information</h1>

    <p>
      Tritonus is a clean room open source implementation of the Java
      Sound 1.0 API for Linux. It is released under the GNU Library
      General Public License.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tritonus is far from being complete and perfect. So volunteers
      are welcome. This page is intended to coordinate the efforts.
    </p>

    <h1>Audio tasks</h1>

    <h2>Audio file support</h2>

    <p>
      Currently supported are .au, .aiff and .wav (reading and
      writing). There is currently some reasoning how data in
      additional chunks can be reflected on the Java side.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, for supporting a new file format in Java Sound, you
      have to implement the
      javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileReader interface for
      reading and the javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter
      interface for writing. 
      For implementing file readers and writers for
      Tritonus, use Tritonus source code as a reference, not Sun
      source code. If you have troubles with buffered vs. unbuffered
      streams, look at how the javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem
      class is implemented in Tritonus or ask Florian.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use new audio file support, change the files
      src/packaging/core/META-INF/service/ and rebuild the jar
      files.
    </p>

    </ul>


    <h2>Audio server support</h2>

    <p>
      Unlike the sun implementation of Java Sound, Tritonus does not
      have its own mixing engine. It generally relies on mixing
      engines available somewhere in the operating system. This has
      the advantage of integrating seamlessly into the existing
      infrastructure
    </p>

    <p>
      Adding support for a new audio server requires implementing the
      interfaces Mixer, SourceDataLine, TargetDataLine and Clip plus
      helper interfaces like MixerProvider and FloatControl. If you
      want to do this, you might have a look at how the existing
      implementation (esd and alsa) is organized.
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Network audio system (nas)</strong>
	<p>
	  NAS is an old but quite poweful audio server. It uses an
	  event-oriented protocol similar to the X protocol.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Playback is unstable: protocoll errors after some minutes,
	  presumably race conditions. Recording and Clips are
	  missing. Volume control is designed but not yet completely
	  implemented. Nice to have: a pure-java client-side library.
	</p>
	<p>
	  NAS is no longer supported by Tritonus.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Enlightenment sound daemon (esd)</strong>
	<p>
	  Esd is a relatively simple, mainly stream-oriented audio
	  server. It is now part of the <a
	  href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME project</a>. Old
	  documentation can be found at <a
	  href="http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/dbdocs/book1.html">The
	  Enlightened Sound Daemon</a>. For newer docs, try to search
	  the GNOME sites (I haven't found anything). The main
	  references I used are the library header files, the example
	  programs and the implementation of convenience functions in
	  the library.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In Tritonus, playback and recording are supported. Clips are
	  supported to a limited degree. Volume control is not
	  supported. Nice to have: a pure-java client-side library. <a
	  href="mailto:aymnk@YAHOO.COM">Atsuhiko Yamanaka</a> has
	  reported to have some hacks around this. It is planned to
	  integrate this for the future. See the <a
	  href="roadmap.html">roadmap</a>.)
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>kaudioserver</strong>
	<p>
	  kaudioserver is the audio server of the KDE project. It is
	  not yet supported. I was not able to locate programming
	  documentation. Try it at <a
	  href="http://www.kde.org/">www.kde.org</a>.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>arts</strong>
	<p>
	  arts is mainly a sound synthesis engine, but can be used as
	  a mixing engine, too. it is now the audio server of KDE 2.X. It is on the medium-term TODO list to support it. See <a
	  href="http://www.arts-project.org/">analog realtime
	  synthesizer</a>.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>YIFF</strong>
	<p>
	  YIFF is not yet supported. See <a
	  href="http://fox.mit.edu/xsw/yiff/">YIFF</a>.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>direct ALSA support</strong>
	<p>
	  ALSA supports sound cards with hardware mixing
	  facilities. Support is under development. See the links on
	  ALSA below.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Compression and conversion support</h2>

    <p>
      Providing facilities to compress and decompress audio data and
      to convert between encodings is done by implementing the
      javax.sound.sampled.spi.FormatConversionProvider.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use new format converters, change the files in
      src/packaging/core/META-INF/service/ and rebuild the jar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are some converters/codecs that come to my mind:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>Standard linear converter</strong>
	<p>
	  Implemented. This converter can convert between mono
	  and stereo and between any channel number and mono.
          It does conversion of big and little endian, 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit.
          Still open: 20bit support.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>A-law and u-law codec</strong>
	<p>
	  Medium priority<br>
	  Now available in Tritonus.
	  <a
	  href="http://cuiwww.unige.ch/OSG/info/AudioFormats/ap10.html">Definition
	  of A-law and u-law</a><br> <a
	  href="http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html">Also see
	  the Sox Source code</a>
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>mp3 decoder</strong>
	<p>
	  Javalayer 0.0.7 has been incorporated
	  into Tritonus.<br> <a href="http://javalayer.sourceforge.net/">Java
	  MP3 Player Project</a><br>
          MP3 file creation implemented by using of LAME library.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Sample rate converter</strong>
	<p>
	  Medium priority.<br> <a
	  href="http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html">Also see
	  the Sox Source code</a>
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>ADPCM, GSM, G723, G721 and other compression schemas</strong>
	<p>
	  Low priority<br> <a
	  href="http://home.sprynet.com/~cbagwell/sox.html">Also see
	  the Sox Source code</a>
	</p>
    </ul>



    <h1>MIDI tasks</h1>

    <p>
      Main parts of the MIDI support are now implemented based on the
      ALSA sequencer. An implementation based on MidiShare is under development. See below.
    </p>

    <p>
      General information on MIDI:
    </p>

      <li><a href="http://crystal.apana.org.au/ghansper/midi_introduction/midi_file_format.html">The MIDI File Format</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Information about interfaces to sound card drivers:</p>

    <p>
      ALSA is preferrable, as it will be the standard Linux soundcard driver in version 2.5 of the kernel.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa/library-source/doc/alsa-lib.html">Advanced Linux Sound Architecture -
                          Library API</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.vande-pol.demon.nl/alsa/">ALSA sequencer proposal</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.4front-tech.com/">Open Sound System (OSS)</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.4front-tech.com/pguide/index.html">OSS Programmer's Guide</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the main tasks:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><strong>MIDI file reading and writing</strong>

	<p>
	  Reading is implemented. Writing and handling of sysex events
	  are experimental.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>A software synthesis engine</strong>

	<p>
	  Perhaps <a
	  href="http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/">TiMidity++</a>
	  can be integrated. There also is a patch to TiMidity to make
	  it act as a client of the ALSA sequencer. However, the
	  author calls it a 'proof-of-concept' and points out that it
	  is not a fully working solution.  Does anybody know of other
	  software synthesizers?
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Interface to hardware synthesizers (on sound cards)</strong>

	<p>
	  Basic playback is implemented for cards whose synth is
	  supported by ALSA. Not yet supported is mute/solo, voice
	  information, soundbank management and some other advanced
	  features.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>External MIDI IN/OUT</strong>

	<p>
	  This is basically implemented based on the ALSA sequencer
	  (MIDI ports are supported on almost all cards that are
	  supported by ALSA at all). However, there are some
	  problems. MIDI IN is working, but is reported to get
	  confused by active sensing events. MIDI OUT is not
	  absolutely stable, too. It's supposed that there are still bugs
	  in ALSA.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Next-generation synthesis engines</strong>

	<p>
	  RMF (Rich Music Format) support cannot be implemented, because the specification
	  of the format is not published by <a href="http://www.beatnik.com/">beatnik</a> and there is no
	  code we can build on. So, other solutions are
	  demanded. Candidates are CSound (there are Java wrappers for
	  it by <a href="mailto:gogins@nyc.pipeline.com">Michael
	  Gogins</a>), <a href="http://www.arts-project.org/">arts
	  (analog realtime synthesizer)</a> and everything around the
	  MPEG-4 Structured Audio standard. See <a
	  href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/mpeg4/">MPEG-4 Structured
	  Audio</a>, <a
	  href="http://sound.media.mit.edu/mpeg4-old/">SAOL / MPEG-4
	  Structured Audio homepage</a>, <a
	  href="http://www.audiomulch.com/sa/">MPEG-4 Structured Audio
	  Page</a>
	</p>
      </li>

    </ul>


    <h1>Administrative and misc tasks</h1>
