    <h2 align="center">Submit a file type proposal</h2>
    <p>
      Please fill in the fields below and press the <i>Submit</i> button to add your
      file type to the database as a proposal. See the <a href="process.html">description
	of the process</a> to find out what will happen after you made your submission.
    <p>
      Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>The ID may only contain letters, numbers, underscore and hyphen. You should
	use capital letters. File type IDs which only differ by their case are considered
	duplicates.
      <li>The extension should be in lowercase and has the same restrictions as the ID.
	It may not contain a dot.<br>
	When a file type may have several extensions (like AIFF -> aif and aiff),
	provide the most common extension and write the alternatives in the comment
	field. Currently, Java Sound only supports one extension per file type.<br>
	It is only of descriptive nature.
      <li>The short description provides a long (technical) name for the file type. Do
	not include specification details.
      <li>Contact is the person or company who submits the file type to the database. 
	It is not necessarily the creator of the file format.
      <li>The comment field should contain additional specifications how to use the file type,
	like e.g. special considerations of supported AudioFormats. Do not include
	technical description how to implement AudioFileWriters or AudioFileReaders. 
	You cannot include html code, but complete http and ftp URL's and email adresses 
	are linked automatically.
      <li>After pressing the <i>Submit</i> button, you'll have the possibility
	to verify your proposal. Further changes can be requested by 
	sending an email to Florian or Matthias.
      <li>With pressing the <i>Submit</i> button you agree that your provided information
	is made publicly available.
    </ul>
