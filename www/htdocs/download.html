   <h1>Download</h1>

   <p>This download page is for people who want (or need) to compile
   Tritonus theirselves. For several common needs, pre-compiled
   binaries are available on the <a href="plugins.html">plug-ins
   page</a>. It is recommanded to have a look there first. It may save
   you much time.</p>

  <p>Ok, now the other case. You have to check out the source code
  from the cvs. Instructions are below. Of course, you need a cvs
  client program for your operating system. In the easiest case, this
  can be the command line cvs on UNIX and UNIX clones (Linux,
  ...). For Windows, WinCVS is a common choice. Or hundrets of
  others. Check out the module 'tritonus'. Then, carefully read the
  file INSTALL in the top-level directory and try to follow it. Note
  that the instructions in this file are still not complete and
  up-to-date. If you're stuck, send a mail to the mailing list <a
  href="mailto:tritonus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">tritonus-devel</a>.</p>


    <h2>CVS</h2>

     <p>The CVS repository contains the very latest changes, making them
      available immediately when they are checked in by the developers.</p>

	<p>To access the CVS, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=1390">instructions</a>. You have to check out the module 'tritonus'.</p>

	<p>You can browse the files and their development history online using the
      <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tritonus/">Web
      interface</a>.
    </p>
