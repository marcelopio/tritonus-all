    <h1>How to use Tritonus</h1>

    <p>Can Tritonus be useful for you? This page is trying to give an idea.</p>


    <p>There are several situations where Tritonus can be useful for you. Typical situations are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You are implementing a Java VM or Java class library. In
      this case, you may want to use Tritonus as complete
      implementation of the Java Sound API. Read on below under
      'Implementor'.</li>

      <li>You are a user of a Java runtime with Java Sound
      implementation. In this case, you may want to use parts of
      Tritonus to augment your Java runtime. The components you can
      use depend on the operating system you are running. Tritonus
      emerged as a Java Sound implementation for Linux. This is why
      most parts that require support by a native library are
      Linux-specific (some can be used on other UNIX-style operating
      systems). If you are running Linux or another variant of UNIX,
      read on below under 'Linux user'. On the other hand, there are
      components that are implemented in pure Java. Obviously, these
      can be used on any operating system. If you are running an
      operating system different from UNIX-like ones (especially
      Windows), read on below under 'Java user'</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementor</h2>

    <p>You can (and we appreciate this) adopt Tritonus in your clean
    room implementation of Java. <a
    href="http://www.kaffe.org/">kaffe</a> has already done this.</p>

    <p>The licence Tritonus uses is the <a
    href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">GNU
    Lesser General Public License (LGPL)</a>. If you think this
    doesn't fit, we can discuss the license issue. It is not totally
    excluded to change the license or to double-license
    Tritonus. However, since changing a license has many implications
    and requires much consideration, it is quite unlikely. In case the
    license of Tritonus is changed, it is highly likely that we will
    adopt a more open one, not a more restrictive one.</p>

    <p>If you want to use Tritonus in your implementation, write a
    mail to <a
    href="mailto:tritonus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">tritonus-devel</a></p>

    <h2>Linux user (including UNIX)</h2>

    <p>Obviously, you can use the components named below under 'Java
    user'. Additionally, you can use these components:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>CDDA extraction. The implementation is based on
      libcdparanoia, the working hourse of cdparanoia. So the
      component should work on any system that has (a moderately
      recent version of) cdparanoia. Precompiled binaries are
      available for Linux x86.</li>

      <li>Esd Mixer. This is the implementation of a MixerProvider
      based on Esound, the Enlightened Sound Daemon. It doesn't give
      you much advantage over common JDK implementation besides that
      it allows you to share the audio device. The component should
      work on any system that has Esound. Precompiled binaries are
      available for Linux x86.</li>

      <li>ALSA Mixer and Sequencer. This is an implementation of a
      MixerProvider and and MidiDeviceProvider. It is recommanded if
      you want high-performance audio or MIDI. Especially, you can use
      this mixer to get full-duplex support and MIDI in/out plus a
      very stable sequencer. Since <a
      href="http://www.alsa-project.org/">ALSA</a> is only available
      for Linux, this component is Linux-specific. Precompiled
      binaries are available for Linux x86.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To get more information and
    download the components, go to <a
    href="http://www.tritonus.org/plugins.html">Plug-ins</a></p>


    <h2>Java user (including Windows)</h2>

    <p>Sorry, no alternative mixer implementation for Windows
    here. However, you can use the following components implemented in
    pure Java:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>GSM06.10 codec</li>

      <li>AudioOutputStream architecture</li>

      <li>Ogg Vorbis decoder (under development)</li>

      <li>mp3 decoder (has severe legal problems, and Vorbis is
      better)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To get more information and
    download the components, go to <a
    href="http://www.tritonus.org/plugins.html">Plug-ins</a></p>
